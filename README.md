* modifying text colour

### Minimum text size
1. Screenshot the game and paste into your preferred image editing tool (MS Paint will do.)
2. Measure the font size from "ascender height" to "descender height".
3. When text includes an outline, only consider that as part of the ascender/descender height when it has a 2:1 contrast ratio.
4. Ensure the font size equals or exceeds: 18px at 1080p or 36px at 4K.

### Modifying text size
The game must provide options to modify the text size to 200%. There is no other mechanism of modifying text size, as Windows or XBOX settings do not carry forward into the game.

1. Check the settings for an option to decrease and increase the text size.

### Modifying text style
Check the settings:
1. Is there at least one sans-seif typeface option?
2. Is there an option to turn off stylised fonts?
3. Does the font support the complete character set for all (supported) languages?
