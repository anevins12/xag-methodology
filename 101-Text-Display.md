## Minimum text size
1. Screenshot the game and paste into your preferred image editing tool (MS Paint will do.)
2. Measure the font size from "ascender height" to "descender height".
3. When text includes an outline, only consider that as part of the ascender/descender height when it has a 2:1 contrast ratio.
4. Ensure the font size equals or exceeds: 18px at 1080p or 36px at 4K.

## Modifying text size
The game must provide options to modify the text size to 200%. There is no other mechanism of modifying text size, as Windows or XBOX settings do not carry forward into the game.

1. Check the settings for an option to decrease and increase the text size.

## Modifying text style
Check the settings:
1. Is there at least one sans-serif typeface option?
2. Is there an option to turn off stylised fonts?
3. Does the font support the complete character set for all (supported) languages?

## Modifying text spacing
This is only applicable to blocks of text that have more than 2 lines:
1. Check if the text meets the minmimum spacing requirements:
  - Line width: Does not exceed 80 characters.
  - Line spacing: 1.5.
  - Paragraph spacing: 2 times larger than line spacing.
  - Letter spacing: 0.12 larger than font size.
  - Word spacing: 0.16 larger than font size.

## Modifying text case and alignment
1. If text is presented in lower case or upper case, is there an option to change to normal sentence capitalisation?
2. Text is aligned according to the language. If a left-to-right language is used the text is aligned left, vice versa.

## Modifying text colour
This is expanded in [Guideline 102]([url](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/xbox-accessibility-guidelines/102)).
Is there an option to modify the text colour along with background colour where applicable?
